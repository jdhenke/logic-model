# Notes
Looking for situations to model and concepts which give rise to paradigms to model them with.
## Prologue
- Agents should themselves be mindless
- So is it bad to include some form of AI in this? It's not really intelligence, or else we've won.
- How about common sense reasoning? Is that knowledge more *mindful* than any program?

## Chapter 1
### 1.1
- builder diagram
- **possible scenario!**

### 1.5
- Talks about building so many layers, that understanding initial layers is now impossible
  - automate the process of building layers?
  - is that learning?
- Relates to common sense

### 1.6
- Essentially describes a builder as a Point, an ADT
- References different view points and how an agents work is not necessarily of concern to its caller

## Chapter 2
### 2.5
- Could we model Builder, the automated block robot?
  - He mentions different stages of doing so
  - Does Justify modeling *doing* something?

## Chapter 3
### 3.1 - Conflict
This chapter should be ripe

- 3.1 Conflict
  - Eat Play Sleep is presented here
  - Wrecker calling Builder is mentioned
  - Mentions things always happening within the context of other things. 
Where does these contexts come from? I don't think a machine would get distracted by physical needs that humnas have.
  - **Conflicts migrate up to higher levels!**. 
  - Modeling this will be tricky.

- 3.2 Noncompromise
  - Principle of Noncompromise
  - References the notion of "taking over" - what does that mean?
