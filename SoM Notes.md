# Notes
Looking for situations to model and concepts which give rise to paradigms to model them with.
## Prologue
- Agents should themselves be mindless
- So is it bad to include some form of AI in this? It's not really intelligence, or else we've won.
- How about common sense reasoning? Is that knowledge more *mindful* than any program?

## Chapter 1
### 1.1
- builder diagram
- **possible scenario!**

### 1.5
- Talks about building so many layers, that understanding initial layers is now impossible
  - automate the process of building layers?
  - is that learning?
- Relates to common sense

### 1.6
- Essentially describes a builder as a Point, an ADT
- References different view points and how an agents work is not necessarily of concern to its caller

## Chapter 2
### 2.5
- Could we model Builder, the automated block robot?
  - He mentions different stages of doing so
  - Does Justify modeling *doing* something?

## Chapter 3
### 3.1 - Conflict
This chapter should be ripe

- 3.1 Conflict
  - Eat Play Sleep is presented here
  - Wrecker calling Builder is mentioned
  - Mentions things always happening within the context of other things. 
Where does these contexts come from? I don't think a machine would get distracted by physical needs that humnas have.
  - **Conflicts migrate up to higher levels!**. 
  - Modeling this will be tricky.

- 3.2 Noncompromise
  - Principle of Noncompromise
  - References the notion of "taking over" - what does that mean?
- 3.6 Pain and Pleasure Simplified
  - Seems to indicate that pain and pleasure *take priority* over other agents. How can we model that? How does that come to be?

## Chapter 4
- 4.2 One Self or Many
  - Can we include some kindof "Voyeur-Puppeteer?"
  - Could we model multiple selves?
    - Different personalities within an argument?
- 4.4 The Conservative Self
  - Keeps us from changing to rapidly
  - Could we model this as an *anti-catalyst* in a discussion in Justify?
- 4.5 Exploitation
  - **Possible Model** - Work exploited Anger to stop Sleep. How do agents translate to Justify and how can this exploitation occur!?
  - This is all **fluid**; no one agent should be able to dominate
    - Perhaps at an instant in time, one *can* dominate
    - Between timesteps, not so much
    - **Where does the impulse come from? Externally or internally!?**
- 4.8 Ideals
  - Describes older agencies affecting the creation of newer ones.
  - Can Justify "create" agencies?
  - Again there is a **temporal element**

## Chapter 5
- 5.1 Circular Causality
  - Two goals can support eachother.
  - **Possible Model**
  - Last paragraph is very interesting, describing DAGs as oversimplified.
- 5.2 Unanswerable Questions
  - Poses question: how can we know when an answer is properly answered?
  - ^Unit testing???
- 5.5 Fashion and Style
  - Fredkin's Paradox - increasingly hard to choose between two increasingly attractive choices
  - **Possible Model**
  - How do we model the *difficulty* of a decision.
- 5.6 Traits
  - Mentions **common sense knowledge** referring to unstated expressions.
  - Could we use common sense knowledge to verify primitives in Jusify?
  - Refers to human nature.
  - Can we model common paradigms i.e. "hostility evokes defensiveness"
